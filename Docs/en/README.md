PTrack2 is a particle recognition software implemented in C++, using some well known design patterns enabling extensibility and code reuse. This software is based on **Mauricio Cerda** C first implementation and **Scott Waitukaitis** variant to recognize particles in high density images for the **Physics department of University of Chile**. The algorithm used is based on the first particle recognition algorithm using convolution based least-squares fitting of **Professor Mark D. Shattuck** implemented in [Matlab](http://gibbs.engr.ccny.cuny.edu/technical/Tracking/ChiTrack.php).
